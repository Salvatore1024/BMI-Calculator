**PROGRAM NAME**:<br>
BMI Calculator

**DESCRIPTION**:<br>
For this project I created a body mass index calculator. The program takes in two data from the 
user(weight and height) and after calculating the index with the specific mathematical formula, gives back a 
body status check based on the resulted BIM. The possible results are: obese, overweight, normal and underweight. 

**USAGE**:<br>
Run the python file and follow the instructions on the terminal.

This program was created during the DfE Skills Bootcamp provided by HyperionDev.
